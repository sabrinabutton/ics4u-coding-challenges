# ICS4U Coding Challenges
Code from in-class coding challenges. These challenges are created by Dan Shiffman.

## A*
This is an algorithm that uses heuristics to find an ideal path while moving. The code in this folder is not substantially edited from what was taught.

## Pixel Sorting
This is an algorithm that sorts pixels in an image from top-to-bottom of the oage in order of brightness. The code in this folder is not substantially edited from what was taught, but I did use a picture of a panda.

## Sparkling Metaballs
This is an algorithm that produces n-dimesional objects by changing the color of the ball as you leave the core. I changed the algorithm so that it uses RGB instead of HSL to calculate this color. I also added a random function to multiply each factor in the square root function that finds the denominator that later allows us to calculate the 'sum'. This makes the metaballs seem sparkly.    

## Snake Gradient
This is an adaptation of the iconic 'snake game' which we learned to code in one of the live coding challenges. In this version, I didn't change much, but I added a feature so that the snake's body gradates as you gain more length, and so that when you go off the screen the snake wraps around the other side.

## Cardioid
This is an algorithm which creates a shape called a 'cardioid', which is a heart shaped curved that rolls around a circle. The code in this folder is not substantially edited from what was taught.
